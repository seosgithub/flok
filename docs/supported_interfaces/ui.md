#User Interface (ui.js)

This driver controls the **semantics** of the visuals shown on screen.  There is no defined layouts, styles, or anything relating to rendering. There is however, a hierarchy description composed of two elements:

 1. Surfaces
 2. Views

###Surfaces
A `Surface` is somewhat analagous to View Controller's from iOSÂ® with the exception that sa surface is embedded within other surfaces.

###Views
Views are *only* embedded within a surface.  You can have one view, one hundred views, or zero views within a `Surface`. Now you might be asking yourself,
wait, I thought you just said a *surface* is embedded in a *surface*, and now you're saying that a *view* is embedded within a *surface*?.

Yes, you read that correctly. A `View` only represents a blank area in a `Surface`; when you embed one `surface` in another `surface` you *must* say *where*. The *where*
is answered by the *view*.

Here's a concrete example to clear any remaining confusion.
![](../images/ui_surface_and_views.png)
In this diagram, you are seeing something akin to a `Navigation` controller that has a permanent navigation bar at the top. Inside this surface, there are two views named `topView`, and `btmView`.
This surface can then accept two sub-surfaces in those two views.
