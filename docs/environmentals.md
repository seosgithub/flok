#Environmentals

Various environmental variables effect both the build, spec, and interface systems.  These environmentals include:
  * `PLATFORM` - The current platform (driver stack) to use. E.g. `chrome`
  * `FLOK_ENV` - Are we in `debug` or `release`
  * `FLOK_CONFIG` - Location of the config.yml, this config.yml must be usable for the the current `PLATFORM`
